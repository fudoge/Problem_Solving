<p>You are playing a game of tic-tac-toe with your friend and you are about to win! Given a tic-tac-toe board that is one step away from victory, make the winning move!</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line will be the number of games that you are playing. Each game board will come in 3x3 blocks of characters, where x and o are players’ markers, and a dash (-) represents an open square. Each board will be followed by a single x or o to represent which player you are. You will have only two of your markers on the board, and you are guaranteed to be able to win the game in one move.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each case, output the line “Case x:” where x is the case number, on a single line. On the next 3 lines, output the board as it will look after your winning move. Use x and o to represent players’ markers and a dash (-) to represent open squares.</p>
